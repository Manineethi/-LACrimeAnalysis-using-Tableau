In this analysis, we aim to explore the dataset and gain insights into crime patterns in Los Angeles. The goal of this study is to make a clear distinction between which type of crime results in the highest victimization rate and how this relates to ethnicity, age, and gender. Another intention of this analysis is to understand the crime category which is more prevalent in the area.
The spatial analysis of crime data is important to understand the category and pattern of crime. The LAPD crime dataset covers the period from 2020 to 2023 (Jan, Feb 2023) and provides insights on various categories of crimes committed in different locations throughout the city of LA.
